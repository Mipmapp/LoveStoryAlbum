# Design Guidelines: Romantic Digital Scrapbook Website

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based:** Handmade scrapbook aesthetic brought to digital life - nostalgic, personal, and heartfelt.

## Visual Theme & Aesthetic

**Color Palette:**
- Soft beige, blush pink, cream, brown, and pastel tones
- Warm, romantic, nostalgic color scheme

**Textures & Materials:**
- Paper textures throughout
- Torn edges on photos/sections
- Tape strips (washi tape aesthetic)
- Polaroid frames with shadows
- Notebook line backgrounds
- Hand-drawn doodles (hearts, arrows, stars)

**Typography:**
- Handwritten fonts: "Dancing Script", "Indie Flower" for personal touches, love notes, captions
- Clean sans-serif: "Poppins" for body text and readability
- Mix handwritten and clean fonts to create scrapbook authenticity

## Layout System

**Spacing:** Organic, slightly irregular spacing to mimic handmade scrapbook
- Photos should be slightly tilted (2-8 degrees rotation)
- Asymmetric placement with soft shadows
- Generous padding to let elements breathe

**Component Positioning:**
- Polaroids: Overlapping, taped appearance with drop shadows
- Sticky notes: Floating with soft shadows, slight rotations
- Elements should feel "pasted" onto pages, not perfectly aligned
